# pacman
The zipped file and the folders hold the code.
This code was built off of another java pacman with some minor tweaks and improvements, most noteably improved graphics. Old project of mine that was done in a week at a summer camp.
Can be run on a computer that has java installed.
Jar file runs the game.
